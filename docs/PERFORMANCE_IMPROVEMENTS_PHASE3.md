# Performance Improvements - Phase 3

## Advanced Caching Strategies

### Multi-Layer Cache
1. **Memory Cache** (React Query)
   - Fastest access
   - Limited by browser memory
   - Cleared on page refresh

2. **IndexedDB Cache**
   - Persistent storage
   - Survives page refreshes
   - 50MB+ storage capacity

3. **Service Worker Cache**
   - Network-first for data
   - Cache-first for assets
   - Background sync support

## Network Optimization

### Request Optimization
- HTTP/2 multiplexing
- Request prioritization
- Connection pooling

### Response Optimization
- Compression (gzip/brotli)
- Minification
- CDN distribution

## Code Quality Improvements

### TypeScript Strict Mode
- Enabled all strict checks
- Catches bugs at compile-time
- Improved code maintainability

### Dead Code Elimination
- Removed unused imports
- Eliminated redundant code
- Tree-shaking optimization

## Security Hardening

### Input Validation
- Zod schemas for all forms
- Sanitization of user inputs
- XSS prevention

### Console Log Removal
- Removed 200+ console.logs
- Implemented structured logging
- Production-safe logger utility

## Final Metrics
