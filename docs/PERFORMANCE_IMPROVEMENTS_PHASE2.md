# Performance Improvements - Phase 2

## Advanced React Optimizations

### Micro-Optimizations
1. **Event Handler Memoization**
   - Use `useCallback` for handlers in lists
   - Prevent recreation on every render

2. **Controlled Component Optimization**
   - Debounce input handlers
   - Throttle scroll events

3. **Context Optimization**
   - Split contexts by update frequency
   - Use context selectors where possible

## Database Query Optimization

### Query Analysis
- Analyzed all Supabase queries
- Reduced N+1 queries
- Added proper JOIN operations

### RLS Policy Performance
- Optimized Row Level Security policies
- Reduced policy complexity
- Added indexes for policy filters

## Asset Optimization

### Static Assets
- Compressed images with WebP
- Minified SVGs
- Removed unused fonts

### Dynamic Loading
- Lazy load below-the-fold content
- Defer non-critical JavaScript
- Use Intersection Observer for visibility
